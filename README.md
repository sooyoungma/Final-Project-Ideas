Soo- Travel Program: 
User can enter parameters based on what they enjoy (hiking, shopping, food, beach, weather, etc) and google flights will return airfare (based on the range the user entered) to cities or countries that match the parameters.  And maybe return a google map pinned with popular tourist spots for a general itinerary. Have to use Google Flights API, TripAdvisor API, and maybe Instagram API to search for popular tags based on location.
